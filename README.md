# KRNY Boilerplate

For the variety of apps I have built, I enjoy utilizing a specific tech stack. While I acknowledge this can be limiting. It allows me to develop mastery over my skill and with the added benefit of iterating quickly.

This boilerplate aims to help speed up the development process, saving the un-necessary boilerplate and reducing duplicate work. The main branch is targeted as having "everything and the kitchen sink". The sub-branches have specific break points in case an app might not need all features.

Main Branch currently include

- React
- TailwindCSS
  - Hero Icons
  - Headless UI
  - Inter Font Family
- ESLint / Prettier
- React Router
  - 404 Page
- React Testing Library / Jest
- React Context

Planned addons

- Cypress

- Github actions (for deploying to GH pages)
